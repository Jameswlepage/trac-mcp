## Overview

This MCP server transforms WordPress Trac into an AI-accessible knowledge base, enabling intelligent queries about WordPress development, ticket tracking, and code changes. Features dual architecture supporting both standard MCP clients and ChatGPT's Deep Research requirements.

## Features

- **Dual Architecture**: Standard MCP + ChatGPT Deep Research support
- Search 60,000+ WordPress tickets by keywords, components, or status
- Get detailed ticket information including descriptions, status, and metadata
- Access changeset information with full diff content
- Monitor recent WordPress development activity
- Retrieve project metadata like components, milestones, and priorities
- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatically detects ticket numbers, revisions, and keywords
- **Smart Caching**: Optimizes fetch operations for better performance
- WordPress-branded UI with official styling

## Installation

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jameswlepage/trac-mcp.git
cd trac-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

### Connect to AI Assistant

#### Standard MCP (Claude Desktop, etc.)

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wordpress-trac": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://your-worker-url/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### ChatGPT Deep Research

ChatGPT uses a different connection method than Claude Desktop. Follow these steps:

1. **Open ChatGPT Settings** â†’ Go to the **Connectors** tab
2. **Add Server** â†’ Import your remote MCP server directly:
   ```
   https://your-worker-url/mcp/chatgpt
   ```
3. **Enable in Composer** â†’ The server will appear in **Composer** > **Deep Research** tool
4. **Add as Source** â†’ You may need to manually add the server as a research source

For detailed setup instructions, see: [ChatGPT MCP Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#connect-in-chatgpt)

> **Note**: ChatGPT requires exactly 2 tools (`search` and `fetch`) with simplified schemas. The `/mcp/chatgpt` endpoint is specifically optimized for this requirement.

## Development

### Local Development
